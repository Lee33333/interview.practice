"""
Recursion

The Evil Wizard Malloc has attacked you and taken away your ability
to use loops! The only way you can defeat him is by fighting back
using the power of recursion!

Below are function stubs for a variety of functions that are able
to be solved recursively. For this exercise, you are not allowed
to use:

  * for loops

  * "while" loops

  * You may use list slicing, but you may not use the "reverse" slice
    (e.g, list[::-1])

  * Any built-in function that achieves the same result

If you run this script from the command line, it will execute the
built-in tests, and let you know which functions are either not
complete or not correct.

When all tests pass, this program will output:

    ** ALL TESTS PASS; GOOD WORK! **
